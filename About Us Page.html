			<h1>FOR THE STORY </h1>
			<div style="text-align:justify;">
			<p>
			We are a team of 4, knowing each other since business school. In fact, we met a few years ago and it was <strong>love at first sight</strong>. We understood each other from the first time we met and we have always had the same way of seeing things. Whether it's during our philosophical debates in class on trivial subjects or on the time to get home when we're out for the night. We have always been <strong>passionate</strong> about fashion and clothes, so creating a clothing brand was for us an obvious choice. 
			We had the idea to create our business and taking into account <strong>the environmental urgency</strong> was self-evident.<br></br> 

			Well, we won't tell our life story any longer, but just know that we are <strong>very proud</strong> of what we have created and of the <strong>community</strong> you are part of. Together we can make things happen, we are the <strong>new generation</strong>, the ones who are not afraid and who are ready for anything!! :)
